# Code of Conduct

<<< Pflugerville Girls Who Code Club >>>

The _purpose_ of the Pflugerville Girls Who Code Club is to engage students in coding activities that build on core coding concepts.  We explain abstract coding concepts by relating them to familiar real-world tasks and processes.  We employ pair programming and individual programming so that each student practices writing and debugging code.  Club members co-create an annual project with guidance from the facilitators.

Our _goal_ is to accomplish our purpose while having fun in the process!
